#It prints the whole function dictionary , the definition for dog twice
#Then it prints true because it ask if cat is in your dictionary
#then it ask if monkey is in the dictionary so it is false
# Dictionary is a list
#I think that it is an error because it isn't in the dictionary but then again it probably should have said false
