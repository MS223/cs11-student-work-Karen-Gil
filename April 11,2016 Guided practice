# what does this function return ?
def print_only(x):
   y = x * 2
   print y
   #the function dose not return nothing


# how is this one different ?
def return_only(x):
   y = x * 2
   return y
# #it dosnt print anything. It just returns it to the computer
# # let's try to use our 2 functions

# print "running print_only ..."
# print_only(7)
# #it will only print the statement "Running print only

# print "running return_only ..."
# return_only(7)
#It will print "running return_only ..." and it will keep te number 14 inside the computer bcause of the return 

# print "printing print_only ..."
# print print_only(7)
#It will print out "printing print_only ..." and since there are 2 prints on line 24 it will print out the number 14 and none because of the out come of the first print in the first eqation 

# print "printing return_only ..."
# print return_only(7)
#It will print "printing return_only ..." and then print out 14

# print "using print_only ..."
# print_only(7) + 6
# It will prinnt out "using print_only ..." and print out 14

print "using return_only ..."
print return_only(7) + 6
# it will keep the number 14 inside the computer and add 6 to it then print out the number 20
